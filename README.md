# My_First_Coding_Project
This project was created as part of my undergraduate coursework for **GMB 315 2.0 - Computer Programming and Web Designing**.

### Assignment Guidelines

The task was to write a Python program that prints a bill based on user input. The requirements were:

* Input: item price, quantity, and discount percentage
* Calculate:

  * **Total** = `item price × quantity`
  * **Discount** = `(total × discount%) / 100`
  * **Amount** = `total - discount`
* Create a simple, clear output showing the results

### How I Created It

I built the program step by step in Python:

* Used `input()` to collect item names, prices, and quantities for up to five items.
* Stored each item’s details in separate variables.
* Calculated line totals for each item using multiplication.
* Asked for a discount percentage, then computed the discount amount and net payable amount.
* Added a header with company name, address, and contact details to simulate a real receipt.
* Formatted numbers to two decimal places for clarity.
* Structured the bill layout with separators (`-`, `=`, and `.`) to make it easy to read.
* Ended the output with a thank-you message and a store notice, similar to what you’d see on a printed bill.

The repository includes:

* **`Bill.py`** – the source code
* **`Bill screenshot.png`** – a screenshot showing a sample run of the program

### What I Learned

Working on this project helped me understand how to:

* Use `input()` to collect user data in Python.
* Apply arithmetic operations for calculations.
* Format numbers for readability (e.g., showing two decimal places).
* Organize console output to look structured, like a real bill.
* Combine logic and formatting to make output both functional and user-friendly.
